# Extraction form elements

## Extraction timer

Numbat automatically times all extractions starting from the first time a user opens the extraction, until the first time they click 'Complete'. This element displays a timer to the user when the extraction is on-going, and allows the user to re-start the timer.

Extractor prompt: 
```
The timer is used to define the average time for extraction.
```

The additional information found below the <b>'(?)'</b> fields is helpful. No need to save the workflow, it takes place automatically. The saving of answers is indicated by a black line shown below the corresponding answer(s).

To learn more details about this extraction form or how to do the extractions visit the ONW <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/oddpub-numbat-workflow-onw-b5vxq67n" target="_blank" title="documentation Numbat">Protocol</a> site.

A quick video tutorial on how to do the extractions can be found under <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/oddpub-numbat-workflow-onw-b5vxq67n?step=7.2" target="_blank" title="tutorial Numbat">Section 7.2</a>.

(i) The datasets are explicitly referred to in the publication; a reference e.g. to <i>Supplementary Materials</i> without further explanation is not sufficient.

(ii)	The data are shared in a <b>machine-readable format</b>; for tables e. g. Excel format, for text e. g. TXT format; PDFs are conditionally machine-readable - they are suitable for texts (with sufficient tagging or structuring), but not for tables because they are not being recognized as such. 

(iii)	The data allow the <b>analytical replication</b> of at least one part of the study results and/or new analyses; listing statistical values (average, standard deviation, p-value, etc.) is not sufficient.  
For further criteria see the individual steps of the Numbat checking workflow. 

(iv) The data record can be retrieved online <b>independently of the article</b>. Tables embedded in articles do not count as <i>Open Data</i> unless they can be accessed as independent digital objects. For this, they have to have their own DOI or accession code AND have been shared independently in an external data repository or website.  

Further explanations are to be found in the corresponding individual steps of the workflow.

### Answer all questions in the extraction form

Sub-extraction: an extraction form element that contains other form elements and can be repeated by the extractor as many times as necessary within an extraction.

Extractor prompt: 
```
Use the <i>Open Data</i> definition shared here. <a href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/projects/incentives/open-data-funds" target="_blank" title="documentation Numbat">here</a>

Beware that this definition includes data shared under restrictions. However, only information on openly shared data is fully extracted using this workflow. 

Also note that the definition includes a few very specific requirements, necessary to align with our use case of incentivizing <i>Open Data</i> sharing at a research performing organization. Make sure to adapt the criteria not only to your institution (if applicable) but also to your specific use case. The adjustments will likely be small, but regard e.g. the time period for which <i>Open Data</i> are considered eligible, and by when possible embargo periods have to have expired. 

(i) Go through <b>all repositories</b> one by one and do the extractions of one dataset per repository by adding <b>each time a new sub-extraction</b>. Some repositories are more likely to contain <i>Open Data</i> than others, and some repositories only contain restricted-access datasets. 

(ii) For each repository in which data has been shared, <b>the first-mentioned dataset</b> has to be evaluated. This has to be repeated for each repository until <b>all</b> eligible repositories have been evaluated.

#### Is there a clear reference to available datasets in the publication?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `reference_to_data`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Inapplicable (e.g. if the article type is 'review', 'opinion' or 'aditional') | n_a |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) Check the <b>article</b> type first, because article types such as <i>review</i>, <i>opinion</i>, or <i>additional</i> are excluded from the examination as they do not represent original research and no new datasets were generated as their basis. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews are considered as (potentially) generating new data and are extracted further. If the article is of a type which does not generate new data, answer <b>'inapplicable'</b>.  

(ii) There must be a statement indicating that <b>raw data</b> have been shared or at least leaving it open, how raw data are. <b>'Raw'</b> is defined loosely here but excludes statistical summary data. A general statement that the supplement contains <i>additional information</i> without any further explanation is not considered a <i>clear reference</i>, and no further checking is necessary. 

To assess this, check whether there is a <b>data availability</b> or <b>data sharing</b> statement/section in the article (see sections 7.3 and 7.4 in the <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/oddpub-numbat-workflow-onw-b5vxq67n" target="_blank" title="documentation Numbat">Protocol</a>). References to the supplemental data must be pursued further, whether the supplements were shared in a repository or on the journal/publisher website. In the latter case, a dataset identifier will be typically unavailable and thus does not need to be entered.

(iii) Data which is to be requested exclusively from the author or data contributor (<i>"data available upon (reasonable) request"</i>) is not considered to be available within this extraction.

#### Can the data be found?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `findability`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: Check, whether the dataset can be found in the <b>indicated location</b>, and thus, whether the findability of the dataset itself independently of the article is given (supplements on journal/publisher websites do not comply with this, check it further). For this, use the <i>identifiers</i>, <i>links</i>, or <i>repository names</i> plus <i>accession codes</i> to open the landing page of the dataset. If the indicated dataset is not directly accessible in this way, search the indicated repository and/or use search engines, according to the below criteria:

(i) Mentioning the repository/database without indicating the <b>accession number</b> or how else the data are to be found in the database is not sufficient to consider the dataset findable.

(ii) <i>“Private links”</i> to datasets, typically intended to share data with reviewers, do not comply with the findability requirement, as the dataset is only accessible through the article.

(iii) Findability in repositories is given, if a search in the repository using the <b>first</b> and <b>last</b> author names and the first five words in the paper title yields a corresponding dataset amongst the first ten search results. If a specific dataset title is indicated, this should be used instead.

(iv) Findability via <b>accession numbers</b> and <b>database names</b> using search engines such as <i>Google</i> to find the database link is still compatible with <i>Open Data</i>. In many cases, the accession number contains the name of the repository (e.g. GSE145594, egas00001004772). The procedure for searching is as follows:
        i. The accession number (and repository name, if available) is/are searched for in Google. 
        ii. If it is among the first 5 search results, the first link should be screened to see whether this is the requested dataset. Use overlap with the article regarding e.g. author names, title, or year.

(v) A link to the <b>own website</b> of the author/researcher or institution is not sufficient unl

#### Commentary to Findability

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_4_findability`

#### Please state the identifier (preferably a link or DOI) of the data that will be used in this extraction.

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `data_identifier`

Extractor prompt: Both for DOIs or other accession codes document an <b>identifier</b> in form of a <b>link</b>. A unique identifier (PID) such as a <i>DOI</i>, a <i>link</i> (URL), or an <i>accession number</i> (always with the database name in which the data is stored) is required for findability.

Please keep in mind that a DOI takes precedence over a URL, as it is the more persistent identifier. So if there is a DOI associated with the data, please reference it.

(i) If the dataset has a <b>DOI</b> (digital object identifier), enter the DOI in form of a link (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1109/XXXX). See Section 7.2 in <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/oddpub-numbat-workflow-onw-b5vxq67n" target="_blank" title="documentation Numbat">Protocol</a> on how to do this.

(ii) If the dataset is referenced by <b>database/repository name</b> and <b>accession code</b>, enter the full link, which will typically contain both the database name and the accession code (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68849). 

(iii) Only if a <i>link</i> cannot be given, enter the database and accession code separately. 

(iv) If supplements were shared in a repository or on the journal/publisher website, a dataset identifier will be typically unavailable, and thus does not need to be entered. 

#### Has the data been shared in a repository?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `not_a_supplement`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) Data <b>in the supplement</b> shared on the journal or publisher website meet the FAIR criteria to a particularly low degree and are difficult to find and reuse. If data have been deposited in this way, they are not considered compatible with <i>Open Data</i> requirements and no further assessment takes place. 

(ii) Supplementary data <b>deposited in repositories<b/> and <b>findable</b> through this repository, and thus <b>independently</b> from the article, are considered compatible with <i>Open Data</i>. A repository is here defined as any platform which allows to access data online, assigns identifiers or minimally a weblink to a dataset landing page, and offers metadata annotation to increase data findability. Acceptable repository types are <i>general-purpose</i> (e.g. Zenodo, figshare), <i>field-specific</i> (e.g. GEO), and <i>institutional repositories</i> (e.g. Harvard Dataverse).

#### Commentary to Repository

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_3_repository`

#### Enter the year of publication of the most recent dataset version (use only a year in the format YYYY):

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `year_of_data_publication`

Extractor prompt: If only one date is available, use this date. 

Otherwise, use the year in which the latest major change to the dataset (upload or update) took place. This most often includes <b>added data</b> or <b>new versions</b> of old data. Changes to the record itself (e.g. new keywords, saving in new formats for same data) are typically <i>not to be considered</i> major changes. However, if uncertain, be liberal and use the <b>latest date</b> of any change to the entry available in the dataset metadata.

#### Can the data be accessed? 

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `data_access`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No, not uploaded or stored | no |
| No, access restricted | restricted |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) Access to the data is possible, i.e. the data can actually be <b>downloaded</b>. This can typically be confirmed by opening the download window. If this is possible, it is to be assumed that data could be downloaded, and an actual download is not necessary. However, in case of doubt, download data to confirm that the downloadable files are actual data and not merely the corresponding metadata. 

(ii) If the data are available under access restrictions (including any type of <i>registration or confirmation of terms of use</i>), they are not to be considered as <i>Open Data</i>. (For our institutional incentives program we do, however, consider restricted-access data, and assess them independently outside this extraction workflow.

(iii) If the data are unavailable due to server downtime or a server error assumed to be temporary, data accessibility is to be checked again on a later day. Unavailability on two different dates is not compatible with <i>Open Data</i> status.

#### Commentary to Accessibility

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_5_data_access`

#### Was the dataset shared under a standardized license?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `dataset_license`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: A license gives the user an overview of how the dataset can be <i>re-used</i> (or not re-used at all). Often the data is not licensed in a standardized way, and instead, there is a <i>bespoke license</i> which is stored only in one place in the repository and applies to each individual record. 

For this question look for a <b>standardized license</b> such as <i>Creative Commons</i> (CC BY, CC BY-SA, etc.) or <i>Open Data Commons</i> (PDDL, ODbL, etc.) on the dataset landing page.

#### Commentary to Licenses

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_1_licenses`

#### Has the shared data been generated by the authors of the corresponding article („Own Data“) or is it re-used data generated by others („Data Reuse”)?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `own_or_reuse_data`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Own Data | own_open-data |
| Data Reuse | open_data_reuse |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) We classify as <b>data reuse</b> all cases where the detected statement indicates that data were <i>collected by others than the authors</i> and were <i>made available through a repository</i> (openly or via a restricted but standardized access route). However, none of the further openness criteria is checked for cases of data reuse.

(ii) If at least <b>one author</b> of the article is also a contributor to the dataset, it is considered to be Own Data. 

(iii) In case no contributors are indicated in the dataset metadata, an explicit <i>reference about Own Data sharing</i> in the publication is sufficient to assume that the data are newly generated data.

(iv) Within the extraction, there is no restriction applied as to whether the own dataset has already been the basis of other publications, or how much time passed between the publication of the dataset and the article. (For our allocation of incentives we do, however, manually exclude datasets which were shared over three years before article publication).

(v) Indicating both Own Data and Data Reuse for the same article is <b>NOT</b> possible. In this case, give preference to the classification as Own Data. 

#### Commentary to Authorship of Data

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_2_own_data`

#### Has the data been shared in a machine-readable format?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `machine_readable_format`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |
| Format was not determined | format_unknown |

Extractor prompt: For tables, the <b>machine-readable</b> formats are e.g. <i>CSV</i> or <i>Excel</i> files, for texts – <i>TXT</i>, <i>DOC</i>, <i>unformatted text</i>, <i>XML</i>. 

PDF and PDF/A are <i>conditionally</i> machine-readable, but because there is no adequate structuring in this format type and it is resource-intensive to check the exact format of a PDF file, <i>PDFs are not considered machine-readable here</i>. Other types of files are always entered as machine-readable. The format might be undetermined e.g. when data are packed in zip files. If these are >200 MB large and a download would be required to check the file type, the format is indicated as undetermined. File formats are typically undetermined for rare data types or very large data, and then it is assumed that the files are in line with <i>Open Data</i> criteria, and the extraction is continued.

Lists from ETH Zurich and Publisso can provide support in case of doubt regarding the machine-readability of file formats, but it should be noted that machine readability is not the same as suitability for digital long-term archiving.  

#### Commentary to Machine Readability

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_6_machine_readability`

#### Which format is the data presented in?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (multiple selection allowed)

Database column prefix: `machine_readable_format`

Extractors were prompted to select one or more of the following options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| XLS/XLSX | excel |
| CSV/TSV | csv_tsv |
| TXT/DOCS | txt_docs |
| Other text or table formats | other_text_formats |
| Video | video |
| Audio | audio |
| Image | picture |
| FASTA/FASTQ | fasta_fastq |
| RAW | raw |
| Other genetic sequences | genetic_sequences |
| Other subject specific format | subject_specific_format |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: Indicate data formats by clicking on the respective tags. Multiple entries are possible.

#### Commentary to Format

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_7_format`

#### If the data is image or audiovisual data: does the data have more than just illustrative character?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `illustrative_files`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Inapplicable | inapplicable |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: Data are purely <b>illustrative</b> if they serve as examples and do not form the full basis for at least a part of the analysis presented in the publication (e.g. for one figure). However, in individual cases, it can be difficult to evaluate whether this is the case. If image or audiovisual data stored in repositories are not explicitly described as examples and if there are at least three files, in case of doubt it can be assumed that they are not purely illustrative.

#### Commentary to Illustrative Files

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_8_illustrative_files`

#### Does the data allow the analytical replication of at least some results?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `analytical_replication`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes (always for OMICS data) | yes |
| No | no |
| Tends to be more positive | replication |
| Tends to be more negative | no_replication |

Extractor prompt: (i) Data must be <b>primary</b>, <b>unprocessed</b>, or <b>"raw"</b> to the extent that they can be the basis for analyses presented in the publication. Thus, tables with individual data point values from which article figures were derived, can be compatible with <i>Open Data</i>, as long as these values are original or preprocessed (e.g. corrected, normalized) outcomes. Indices or other highly processed values, as well as summary statistics, are, in contrast, not considered compatible with <i>Open Data</i>. In line with this, lists of genes, proteins, or similar units with associated individual p-values are not sufficient.  The pure amount of data is not decisive. Even very small tables can contain raw data if the sample size is small. If several measured values are listed for a unit of observation, sufficiently unprocessed data can be assumed in case of doubt. Generally speaking, borderline cases inevitably occur at this step, in which case we tend to be liberal.
 
(ii) <b>OMICS data</b> in disciplinary formats – given they fulfilled all criteria so far - are always to be assessed as allowing analytical replication. (This criterion was introduced partly for lack of disciplinary expertise, and could be adjusted, if such expertise is present.)

To allow for granularity in the decision process, "yes" and "no" decisions are both split into cases of either <i>high</i> or <i>low</i> certainty.  The latter is indicated by the reservation that the choice "tends to be" yes or no. In either case, the extraction continues with an overall assessment of <i>Open Data</i> status performed.
 

#### Commentary to Analytical Replication

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_9_analytical_replication`

#### Have the Open Data requirements been met? Is a discussion necessary?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `open_data_assessment`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Open Data, no discussion needed | open_data |
| Unsure, discussion needed | unsure_open_data |
| No Open Data, no discussion needed | no_open_data |

Extractor prompt: Enter the overall assessment of the <i>Open Data</i> status of the extracted dataset. We recommend extensive commenting, especially at this step, to make sure that difficult decisions can be reconstructed. Please note that, comments made here are, however, not available to other extractors if the same dataset is additionally assigned to them.

#### Commentary to Assessment

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_10_assessment`

#### Data Reuse Statement, as well as the article types like 'opinion paper', 'review' or additional', will not be pursued. Please leave here a comment if needed and click on completed.

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `other_comments`

#### Add a new dataset by adding a new sub-extraction

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_other_datasets`

Extractor prompt: If the article refers to data from further location(s) (typically if more than one repository is mentioned per article), click on "Add new sub-extraction" to begin the next extraction of <i>Open Data</i> status for a dataset in a different location.

## Please click on completed to finish the extraction.
