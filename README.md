# Authors

# Description
The Openness extraction form was implemented to support the automatedly detected Open Data statements by the [ODDPub](https://github.com/quest-bih/oddpub) text mining algorithm by guiding and documenting the manual validation of Open Data statements. The extraction form was implemented in [Numbat](https://github.com/bgcarlisle/Numbat), a software developed aimed to extract information for the systematic reviews and manage the resulting databases, also in large volumes.

Thus, the process of the Open Data detection consists currently of 3 steps:

1. Automated Open Data statements detection by ODDPub.
2. Data preparation for manual validation.
3. Manual validation in Numbat Openness extraction form.

# Protocol on Usage

The [interactive protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/oddpub-numbat-workflow-onw-b5vxq67n?step=4) on the Openness form usage are published in protocols.io.
