# Extraction form details

Openness (en) 2022 version 2.1



[ungeFAIR]()

# Extraction form elements

## Extraction timer

Numbat automatically times all extractions starting from the first time a user opens the extraction, until the first time they click 'Complete'. This element displays a timer to the user when the extraction is on-going, and allows the user to re-start the timer.

Extractor prompt: 
```
The timer is used to define the average time for extraction.
```

## The requirements for Open Data (click (?) for more information)

Extractor prompt: 
```
 Test: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00749-y/tables/2" target="_blank" title="documentation Numbat">Protocol</a>
(i)	The datasets are explicitly referred to a reference in the publication; e.g. to <i>Supplementary Materials</i> without further explanation is not sufficient.  

(ii)	The data are shared in a <b>machine-readable format</b>; for tables e. g. Excel format, for text e. g. Word format; PDFs are conditionally machine-readable - they are suitable for texts (with sufficient tagging or structuring), but not for tables because they are not being recognized as such.  

(iii)	The data allow the <b>analytical replication</b> of at least one part of the study results and/or new analyses; to mention the statistical numerical values (average, standard deviation, p-value, etc.) is not sufficient.   
For further criteria see the individual steps of the Numbat checking workflow. 

```

### Please, answer the following questions to assess the openness of data:

Sub-extraction: an extraction form element that contains other form elements and can be repeated by the extractor as many times as necessary within an extraction.

Extractor prompt: 
```
(i) Go through <b>all repositories</b> one by one and do the extractions of one dataset per repository by adding <b>each time a new sub-extraction</b>. Some repositories are more likely to contain Open Data than others, and some repositories only contain restricted-access datasets. 

(ii) For each repository in which data has been shared, <b>the first-mentioned dataset</b> has to be evaluated. This has to be repeated for each repository until <b>all</b> eligible repositories have been evaluated.
   
```

#### Is there a clear reference to available datasets in the publication?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `reference_to_data`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Inapplicable (e.g. if the article type is 'review', 'opinion' or 'aditional') | n_a |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) Check the <b>article</b> type first, because article types such as <i>review</i>, <i>opinion</i>, or <i>additional</i> are excluded from the examination as they do not represent primary research and no new datasets were generated as their basis.  

(ii) There must be a clear statement in the publication that <b>raw datasets</b> have been shared. For this, check whether there is a <b>data availability</b> or <b>data sharing</b> statement/section in the article. Reference to the supplement(s) must be pursued further, whether the supplement materials were shared within the publication repository or in the external data repository/website. In this case, continue with the extraction. A general statement that the supplement contains <i>additional information</i> is not sufficient.

(iii) Reference to the data which is available exclusively <b>upon request</b> by the author or data contributor might not be considered Open Data. Look for other dataset references in the article, otherwise stop the extraction by choosing the answer “No”.

#### Can the data be found?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `findability`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: Mentioning the repository/database without indicating the <b>accession number</b> or how else the data are to be found in the database is not sufficient to consider the dataset findable.

In addition to findability through the article, findability through repositories themselves and/or search engines needs to be ensured. Thus, “private links” to datasets, typically intended to share data with reviewers, do not comply with the findability requirement. Findability in repositories is given, if a search in the repository using the <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> author names and <i>the first five words</i> in the paper title yields a corresponding dataset amongst the first ten search results. If a specific dataset title is indicated, this should be used instead. 

#### Commentary to Findability

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_4_findability`

#### Please state the identifier (preferably a link or DOI) of the data that will be used in this extraction.

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `data_identifier`

Extractor prompt: Both for DOIs or other accession codes please document an <b>identifier</b> in form of a <b>link</b>, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1109/XXXX.

(i) If the dataset does not have a DOI (digital object identifier), enter the link to the dataset. Thus, for datasets that are referenced by database/repository name and accession code, enter the <i>full link</i> which will typically contain both the <b>database name</b> and the <b>accession code</b>. Only if a link cannot be given, enter database and accession code separately.  

(ii) An independent digital object is present if the data record can be retrieved online independently of the article. Tables embedded in articles do not count as open data unless they can be accessed as independent digital objects, which means they have its own DOI or accession code AND were shared independently in the external data repository or website. 

(iii) A <i>persistent identifier</i> (PID) such as a <b>DOI</b>, <b>a link</b> (URL), or an <b>accession number</b> (always with the database name in which the data is stored) is required for findability.  
i.	Findability via accession numbers and database names using search engines such as Google to find the database link is still compatible with Open Data. In many cases, the accession number contains the name of the repository (e.g. GSE145594, egas00001004772). The procedure for searching is as follows: 

a. The accession number is searched for in Google.  

b. If it is among the first 5 search results, the first link should be screened to see whether this is the requested dataset. The helpful criteria are the author's name, title, year, etc. 
    
ii.	Reference to a repository or a database without an accession number or PID is not compatible with Open Data.  
iii.	Accordingly, a link to the own website of the author/researcher or institution is not sufficient, unless it is immediately and without further searching evident where on the website the dataset is located.    

#### Has the data been shared in a repository?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `not_a_supplement`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) Data <b>in the supplement</b> meet the FAIR criteria to a particularly low degree and are difficult to find and reuse. Thus, they are not considered <i>Open Data</i> here.  

(ii) It may be a case that supplementary data have been <b>deposited in a repository</b>. Such data are considered <b>compatible</b> with Open Data requirements, and the assessment of the Open Data status continues. This is due to such datasets being better as well as independently findable. A <b>repository</b> is here defined as any platform which allows to access data online, assigns identifiers or minimally a weblink to a dataset landing page, and offers metadata annotation to increase data findability. Acceptable repository types are general-purpose (e.g. Zenodo, figshare), field-specific (e.g. GEO), and institutional repositories (e.g. TUdatalib).

(iii) If, in contrast, data have been deposited with the article on the website of the journal or publisher, this is not considered compatible with Open Data requirements, and no further assessment takes place. 

#### Commentary to Repository

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_3_repository`

#### Can the data be accessed? 

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `data_access`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No, not uploaded or stored | no |
| No, access restricted | restricted |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) Access to the data is possible, i.e. the data can actually be <b>downloaded</b>. This can typically be confirmed by opening the download window. If this is possible, it is to be assumed that data could be downloaded, and an actual download is not necessary. However, in case of doubt, download data to confirm that the downloadable files are actual data and not merely the corresponding metadata. 

(ii) If the data are available under access restrictions (including any type of <b>registration or confirmation of terms of use</b>), they are <b>not to be considered as Open Data</b>. [Restricted-access data are, however, considered in the OD-LOM, and are to be checked independently to confirm whether LOM is justified.] 

(iii) If the data are unavailable due to server downtime or a server error assumed to be temporary, data accessibility is to be checked again on a later day. Unavailability on two different dates is not compatible with Open Data status. 

#### Commentary to Accessibility

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_5_data_access`

#### Was the dataset shared under any standardized license?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `dataset_license`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: A license gives the user an overview of how the dataset can be <i>re-used</i> (or not re-used at all). Often the data is not licensed because there is a such called <i>bespoke license</i> which is stored only in one place in the repository and applies to each individual record. For this question:

(i) Look for a <b>standardized license</b> such as <i>Creative Commons</i> (CC BY, CC BY-SA, etc.) or <i>Open Data Commons</i> (PDDL, ODbL, etc.).

(ii) If there is no license from a Tags list on the dataset landing page, add new license name in the corresponding window below.

#### Commentary to Licenses

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_1_licenses`

#### Has the shared data been generated by the authors of the corresponding article („Own Data“) or is it re-used data generated by others („Data Reuse”)?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `own_or_reuse_data`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Own Data | own_open-data |
| Data Reuse | open_data_reuse |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: (i) We classify as <b>data reuse</b> all cases where the detected statement indicates that data were <i>collected by others than the authors</i> and were <i>made available through a repository</i>; this and other parameters of openness are then not checked, however. If <i>at least one author</i> of the publication is also a <i>contributor</i> to the dataset, it is considered to be <b>Own Data</b>. 

(ii) In case no contributors are indicated in the dataset metadata, an explicit <i>reference about Own Data sharing</i> in the publication is sufficient to assume that the data are newly generated data. There is no restriction applied as to whether the own dataset has already been the basis of other publications, and how much time passed between the publication of the dataset and article, respectively. [For OD-LOM assessment note as a comment whether the dataset might be the basis of earlier publications (to avoid multiple rewards for the same dataset) or is older than three years]

(iii) Indicating both Own Data and Data Reuse for the same article is <b>NOT</b> possible. In this case, give preference to the classification as Own Data. 

#### Commentary to Ownership of Data

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_2_own_data`

#### Has the data been shared in a machine-readable format?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `machine_readable_format`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Unsure | unsure |
| Format was not determined | format_unknown |

Extractor prompt: (i) The data was shared in a <b>machine-readable format</b>. For tables these are e.g. <i>CSV</i> or <i>Excel</i> files, for texts – <i>TXT</i>, <i>DOC</i>, unformatted text, <i>XML</i>; PDF and PDF/A are conditionally machine-readable, but because there is no adequate structuring in this format type and it is resource-intensive to check the exact format of a PDF file, <b>PDFs are not considered machine-readable here</b>. Other types of files are always entered as machine-readable. The format might be undetermined e.g. when data are packed in zip files. If these are >200 MB large and a download would be required to check the file type, the format is indicated as undetermined. File formats are typically undetermined for rare data types or very large data, and thus it is assumed that the files are in line with Open Data criteria, and the extraction is continued. 

(ii) Lists from ETH Zurich and Publisso can provide support in case of doubt regarding machine-readability of file formats, but it should be noted that machine readability is not the same as suitability for digital long-term archiving.  

#### Commentary to Machine Readability

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_6_machine_readability`

#### In what format is the data presented? (multiple entries possible)

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (multiple selection allowed)

Database column prefix: `machine_readable_format`

Extractors were prompted to select one or more of the following options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| XLS/XLSX | excel |
| CSV/TSV | csv_tsv |
| TXT/DOCS | txt_docs |
| Other text or table formats | other_text_formats |
| Video | video |
| Audio | audio |
| Image | picture |
| FASTA/FASTQ | fasta_fastq |
| RAW | raw |
| Other genetic sequences | genetic_sequences |
| Other subject specific format | subject_specific_format |
| Unsure | unsure |

#### Commentary to Format

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_7_format`

#### If the data is image or audiovisual data: does the data have more than just illustrative character?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `illustrative_files`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes | yes |
| No | no |
| Inapplicable | inapplicable |
| Unsure | unsure |

Extractor prompt: Data are purely <b>illustrative</b> if they serve as examples and do not form the full basis for at least a part of the analysis presented in the publication (e.g. for one figure). However, in individual cases, it can be difficult to evaluate whether this is the case. If image or audiovisual data stored in repositories are not explicitly described as examples and if there are at least three files, in case of doubt it can be assumed that they are not purely illustrative.

#### Commentary to Illustrative Files

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_8_illustrative_files`

#### Does the data allow the analytical replication of at least some results?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `analytical_replication`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Yes (always for OMICS data) | yes |
| No | no |
| Tends to be more positive | replication |
| Tends to be more negative | no_replication |

Extractor prompt: (i) Data must be <b>primary</b>, <b>unprocessed</b>, or <b>"raw"</b> to the extent that they can be the basis for analyses presented in the publication. The data may already be corrected or otherwise processed, but they must be substantially <i>more detailed than summary statistics</i>. Lists of genes, proteins, or similar units with associated individual p-values are not sufficient. The pure amount of data is not decisive. Even very small tables can contain raw data if the sample size is small. If several measured values are listed for a unit of observation, sufficiently unprocessed data can be assumed in case of doubt.  

(ii) OMICS data – given they fulfilled all criteria so far - are <i>always</i> to be considered as allowing analytical replication. 

#### Commentary to Analytical Replication

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_9_analytical_replication`

#### Have the Open Data requirements been met? Is a discussion necessary?

Sub-extraction variable type: Categorical (single selection only)

Database column name: `open_data_assessment`

Extractors were prompted to select one of the following mutually exclusive options.

| Displayed option name | Database value |
|:----------------------|---------------:|
| Open Data, no discussion needed | open_data |
| Unsure, discussion needed | unsure_open_data |
| No Open Data, no discussion needed | no_open_data |

#### Commentary to Assessment

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_10_assessment`

#### Data Reuse Statement, as well as the article types like 'opinion paper', 'review' or additional', will not be pursued. Please leave here a comment if needed and click on completed.

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `other_comments`

#### If there are references to the data from a different repository, please state a dataset by adding a new sub-extraction.

Sub-extraction variable type: Open text field

Database column name: `comment_other_datasets`
